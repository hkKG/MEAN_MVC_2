## config.js - contains configuration code of our Express application



## app.js - contains initialization code of our Express application

#exports-object is contained in each module and allows you to expose pieces of your code when the module is loaded
#module-object was originally used to provide metadata information about the module. It also contains the pointer to an exports object as a property
