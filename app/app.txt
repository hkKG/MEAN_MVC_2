The app folder is where we'll keep our Express application logic and is divided into the following folders
that represent a separation of functionality to comply with the MVC pattern:

controllers - contains Express application controllers

models - contains Express application models

routes - contains Express application routing middleware

views - contains Express application views

So, basicalls, this whole MVC thing is jast away
you structure your application in order
to help yoe maintain it later when the project becomes big...
